            Welcome to our EECS 149/249A project: an affordable, robust, and safe automatic cheese grater for home kitchens.

        <div class="section-title">Our Why</div>
        <div class="section-bar"></div>
        <p>
            Commercial automatic cheese graters are prohibitively expensive, often costing $200 or more. 
            For many home cooks, this means grating cheese by hand-a tedious, tiring, and sometimes unsafe process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our motivation was to design and build an affordable, robust, and safe automatic cheese grater that could be built for under $400. 
            We wanted to make the joy of freshly grated cheese accessible to more people, while ensuring safety and reliability.

        <p>
            Our project aims to bridge the gap between expensive commercial cheese graters and the needs of everyday home cooks. 
            By leveraging a custom lead screw compression mechanism, robust electronics, and a safe design, we have created a device 
            that automates the process of grating hard cheeses like parmesan.

            On this site, you'll find an overview of our design process, hardware and software integration, and our results.
            We hope our work inspires further innovation in accessible kitchen automation!

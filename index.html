            <p>Welcome to our EECS 149/249A project: an affordable, robust, and safe automatic cheese grater for home kitchens.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Our project aims to bridge the gap between expensive commercial cheese graters and the needs of everyday home cooks. 
            By leveraging a custom lead screw compression mechanism, robust electronics, and a safe design, we have created a device 
            that automates the process of grating hard cheeses like parmesan.

            On this site, youâ€™ll find an overview of our motivation, team, design process, hardware and software integration, and our results.
            We hope our work inspires further innovation in accessible kitchen automation!
